One can follow the below steps to use our "Travel Guide" application --

1. Open the index.html page to start using the "Travel Guide"

2. Type the city you’re traveling to in the “Where” search box. Type your origin into the “Starting Point” box. The application will use this origin later to give you directions.

3. If no filters are selected, all ‘things to do’ in the given city will appear. If you’d like only certain types of locations, select the proper filter.

4. On the map, select location markers to add them to your itinerary. Once you have all desired locations in your itinerary, click “Make Itinerary”.

5. After you’ve made your itinerary, click “Get Directions” to be given a map and driving directions. You can save this itinerary to view it later.
